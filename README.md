# 2digitcounter

## 2 digit counter using IC 7447 made in logisim

Although [Logisim](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/) is a decade old software and has been discontinued, it's still a very good free and open source logic simulator and has helped me learn a lot about circuit design. So I decided to share this work.

Right now it has been picked up and continued as [Logisim-Evolution](https://github.com/logisim-evolution/logisim-evolution), but the files uploaded here were made using the older, discontinued version.

It's not much but it's honest work ;)
